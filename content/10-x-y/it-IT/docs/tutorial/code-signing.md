# Firma Codice

Code signing is a security technology that you use to certify that an app was created by you.

Su macOS il sistema può rilevare ogni modifica all'app, che la modifica sia introdotta accidentalmente o da un codice maligno.

On Windows, the system assigns a trust level to your code signing certificate which if you don't have, or if your trust level is low, will cause security dialogs to appear when users start using your application.  Trust level builds over time so it's better to start code signing as early as possible.

While it is possible to distribute unsigned apps, it is not recommended. Both Windows and macOS will, by default, prevent either the download or the execution of unsigned applications. Starting with macOS Catalina (version 10.15), users have to go through multiple manual steps to open unsigned applications.

developer cannot be verified](../images/gatekeeper.png)

Come puoi vedere, gli utenti hanno due opzioni: Spostare l'app direttamente al cestino o annullarne l'esecuzione. Non vuoi che i tuoi utenti vedano quella finestra.

Se stai creando un'app Electron che intendi impacchettare e distribuire, dovrebbe essere firmata nel codice.

# Signing & notarizing macOS builds

Properly preparing macOS applications for release requires two steps: First, the app needs to be code-signed. Then, the app needs to be uploaded to Apple for a process called "notarization", where automated systems will further verify that your app isn't doing anything to endanger its users.

To start the process, ensure that you fulfill the requirements for signing and notarizing your app:

1. Enroll in the [Apple Developer Program][] (requires an annual fee)
2. Download and install [Xcode][] - this requires a computer running macOS
3. Genera, scarica ed installa [certificati di firma][]

Electron's ecosystem favors configuration and freedom, so there are multiple ways to get your application signed and notarized.

## `electron-forgia`

If you're using Electron's favorite build tool, getting your application signed and notarized requires a few additions to your configuration. [Forge](https://electronforge.io) is a collection of the official Electron tools, using [`electron-packager`][], [`electron-osx-sign`][], and [`electron-notarize`][] under the hood.

Let's take a look at an example configuration with all required fields. Not all of them are required: the tools will be clever enough to automatically find a suitable `identity`, for instance, but we recommend that you are explicit.

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "config": {
    "forge": {
      "packagerConfig": {
        "osxSign": {
          "identity": "Developer ID Application: Felix Rieseberg (LT94ZKYDCJ)",
          "hardened-runtime": true,
          "entitlements": "entitlements.plist",
          "entitlements-inherit": "entitlements.plist",
          "signature-flags": "library"
        },
        "osxNotarize": {
          "appleId": "felix@felix.fun",
          "appleIdPassword": "my-apple-id-password",
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `plist` file referenced here needs the following macOS-specific entitlements to assure the Apple security mechanisms that your app is doing these things without meaning any harm:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.debugger</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

To see all of this in action, check out Electron Fiddle's source code, [especially its `electron-forge` configuration file](https://github.com/electron/fiddle/blob/master/forge.config.js).


## `electron-builder`

Electron Builder comes with a custom solution for signing your application. You can find [its documentation here](https://www.electron.build/code-signing).

## `electron-packager`

If you're not using an integrated build pipeline like Forge or Builder, you are likely using [`electron-packager`][], which includes [`electron-osx-sign`][] and [`electron-notarize`][].

If you're using Packager's API, you can pass [in configuration that both signs and notarizes your application](https://electron.github.io/electron-packager/master/interfaces/electronpackager.options.html).

```js
const packager = require('electron-packager')

packager({
  dir: '/path/to/my/app',
  osxSign: {
    identity: 'Developer ID Application: Felix Rieseberg (LT94ZKYDCJ)',
    'hardened-runtime': true,
    entitlements: 'entitlements.plist',
    'entitlements-inherit': 'entitlements.plist',
    'signature-flags': 'library'
  },
  osxNotarize: {
    appleId: 'felix@felix.fun',
    appleIdPassword: 'my-apple-id-password'
  }
})
```

The `plist` file referenced here needs the following macOS-specific entitlements to assure the Apple security mechanisms that your app is doing these things without meaning any harm:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.debugger</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

# Signing Windows builds

Prima di firmare le build di Windows, devi fare quanto segue:

1. Get a Windows Authenticode code signing certificate (requires an annual fee)
2. Install Visual Studio to get the signing utility (the free [Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is enough)

Puoi ottenere un certificato di firma del codice da molti rivenditori. Prices vary, so it may be worth your time to shop around. I rivenditori popolari includono:

* [digicert](https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/microsoft-authenticode.htm)
* [Comodo](https://www.comodo.com/landing/ssl-certificate/authenticode-signature/)
* [GoDaddy](https://au.godaddy.com/web-security/code-signing-certificate)
* Amongst others, please shop around to find one that suits your needs, Google is your friend 😄

Ci sono molti strumenti per firmare la tua app impacchettata:

- [`electron-winstaller`][] will generate an installer for windows and sign it for you
- [`electron-forge`][] can sign installers it generates through the Squirrel.Windows or MSI targets.
- [`electron-builder`][] can sign some of its windows targets
